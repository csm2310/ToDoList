Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm installed

Firebase Project setup with authentication enabled

Backend server (for email reminders)


Steps to Run

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/todo-list.git
cd todo-list


2. Install Dependencies

npm install


3. Start the React App

npm start

The app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.


4. Backend Setup (for Email Reminders)

A Node.js backend should be running at http://localhost:5000.

Example Express.js backend:

const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: { user: 'your-email@gmail.com', pass: 'your-password' },
});

app.post('/sendReminder', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, task, reminderTime } = req.body;
  try {
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: 'your-email@gmail.com',
      to: email,
      subject: 'Task Reminder',
      text: `Reminder for your task: "${task}" scheduled at ${reminderTime}`,
    });
    res.status(200).send('Email sent');
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error sending email');
  }
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log('Server running on port 5000'));
